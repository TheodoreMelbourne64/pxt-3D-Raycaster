# pxt-3D-Raycaster
A simple 3-D raycaster for the micro:bit.
The “set map to ()” and “start raycasting” blocks are required for the 3-dimensional effect to operate. With the “set map to ()” block, if you would like a tile to be placed there, enter an “#” character. If not, insert a period. Make new lines to make objects. For example:

“#######
 #. .##. .#
 #. . . . . #
 #. .# . . #
 #######”

would create a string of 3-D objects placed in the order that you add them in.

(Please note: Only a fill texture can be applied to the tiles.)
